/* Library-mode profile: the published configuration file an embedder ships to

 *                                              // hashing contract
 *   }
 *
 * The COMPILATION ROOT for sidecar purposes is the profile file's
 * directory: the sidecar's `entry` field and the build_id/source_hash
 * canonical module paths are root-relative POSIX paths. The identity
 * getters are pure data returns exempt from the poisoned guard and every
 * runtime touch (ratified): callable before init and after a trap.
 *
 * Multi-instance library mode (`abi.localize_runtime: true`): the archive's
 * runtime internals — allocator, cycle collector, result arena, panic-sink
 * registration, every other piece of runtime state — are demoted to LOCAL
 * symbols behind the profile's prefix, so an ordinary archive's only
 * external definitions are the profile-declared symbols. External references
 * are the target's C/math runtime and system APIs: Windows embedders
 * additionally link advapi32, iphlpapi, and ws2_32, while the platform driver
 * supplies its ordinary CRT and kernel imports. Sanitized artifacts also
 * carry their sanitizer ABI; Darwin ASan's image-registration COMMON
 * deliberately remains shared so the final Mach-O image registers its
 * globals exactly once. N such archives, built under pairwise-distinct
 * prefixes, then link into ONE process with no scriptc-runtime symbol
 * collisions or shared
 * mutable state: each instance owns a private copy of the whole runtime,
 * panic sinks register per instance, and a trap poisons only the instance it
 * fired in. The embedder contract that makes this sound:
 *
 *   - Each instance keeps the single-threaded execution model. The embedder
 *     confines each instance to one thread and never enters one instance
 *     from two threads; different instances may run on different threads
 *     concurrently.
 *   - No value crosses instances directly: results are instance-owned
 *     memory with instance-tied lifetimes, so data moves between instances
 *     only through the embedder's own byte/record marshalling.
 *
 * Off by default: an absent or false `localize_runtime` produces the
 * classic artifact, byte-for-byte. Localization follows the archive's
 * object format: ELF and COFF archives localize on any supported host
 * (native or cross); Mach-O localization runs the macOS host linker, so
 * macos and ios targets build on darwin hosts and refuse elsewhere with
 * SC3002.
 *
 * Mobile targets: SCRIPTC_TARGET=aarch64-apple-ios,
 * aarch64-apple-ios-simulator, and aarch64-linux-android build library
 * archives for an embedding app to link (Xcode / Gradle+NDK); the
 * executable lane refuses those triples with SC3002. The minimum-version
 * floors are part of the target contract: iOS archives build for iOS 15.0
 * (every object carries LC_BUILD_VERSION minos 15.0 for the device or
 * simulator platform), Android archives for API level 26 (the bionic stub
 * level the embedder's minSdkVersion must meet). iOS targets require a
 * darwin host with Xcode's iPhoneOS/iPhoneSimulator SDK; Android targets
 * require an NDK (ANDROID_NDK_ROOT, or discovered under the SDK's ndk/
 * directory) on any host. Both `localize_runtime` and
 * `instance_per_thread` compose with the mobile targets exactly as on
 * desktop targets: iOS localization rides the Mach-O recipe, Android the
 * in-process ELF transform.
 *
 * Thread-instanced state (`abi.instance_per_thread: true`): every mutable
 * piece of the archive's state — the runtime units' internals AND the
 * program's globals, run-once guards, and lazily-compiled regex literal
 * caches — compiles as thread-local storage, so ONE linked archive serves
 * N instances: a thread that calls the init entry owns a complete,
 * independent instance through the unchanged entry family (no handle
 * parameter exists; the calling thread IS the instance selector). Sinks,
 * the poison flag, the result arena, and the collector are all
 * per instance, so a trap poisons only the instance it fired in. The
 * contract extends the multi-instance one:
 *
 *   - One instance per thread, selected implicitly by the calling thread;
 *     each thread that will serve requests calls the init entry first.
 *   - An instance's lifetime is its thread's lifetime; entering it from
 *     any other thread is undefined (unchanged rule). Ending a thread ends
 *     its instance without teardown — memory owned by the instance is
 *     reclaimed at process exit, so long-lived pools should reuse threads
 *     rather than cycle them.
 *   - No value crosses instances (the marshalling rule above, unchanged).
 *
 * Independent of `localize_runtime`, and composable with it: a thread-
 * instanced archive that must coexist with OTHER archives in one process
 * declares both. Off by default; non-opted builds are byte-for-byte
 * unchanged.
 *
 * Host-callback channels (`callbacks` + `abi.callback_register_symbol`):
 * the mode's outbound seam. A library's default outbound channels are
 * entry return values and the panic sink; a declared callback channel adds
 * a synchronous byte/scalar path from compiled code to the embedder — the
 * sink's pattern generalized: a profile-named registration symbol, a
 * host-supplied function pointer plus opaque context, calls arriving on
 * the calling thread. Each channel entry declares:
 *
 *   - `name`: the channel's identity — the registration name string AND
 *     the TypeScript binding compiled code calls. Program code reaches the
 *     channel as a signature-only ambient declaration whose signature must
 *     fit the declared classes (`declare function emitChunk(chunk:
 *     Uint8Array, seq: number): void`); a call of such a declaration that
 *     names no channel refuses SC4024 (only when the profile declares at
 *     least one channel — a callback-free profile keeps the ordinary
 *     ambient ReferenceError semantics, and its artifact is unchanged).
 *     Direct calls only, the FFI binding rule.
 *   - `params`: f64, bool, string, bytes, and the u8/u32/i32 plumbing
 *     classes (outbound plumbing rides JS's own ToUint32/ToInt32, the
 *     executable FFI lane's rule). string/bytes arrive as (ptr, len)
 *     pairs BORROWED for the duration of the call only.
 *   - `returns`: f64, bool, u8, u32, i32, or void — scalars only (a
 *     buffer return needs an ownership contract the mode does not define,
 *     the FFI format-1 ruling).
 *
 * The registration symbol's C shape, one per profile:
 *
 *   int32_t <sym>(const char *name, void (*fn)(void), void *ctx);
 *
 * name selects the channel by its declared `name` (NUL-terminated); fn is
 * stored as shown and cast to the channel's typed shape at the call site:
 *
 *   <ret> (*)(void *ctx, <params...>)   // ctx first, the sink's layout
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, -1 for an unknown or NULL name (a defined
 * refusal, never a store). Latest registration wins; a NULL fn clears the
 * channel; registration is a pure store — no entry prologue, no poison
 * guard, legal before init — and registrations persist across init/reset.
 * Calling a channel the host never registered is the SC4025 runtime trap
 * through the panic sink (structured, naming the channel in the text and
 * the entry the host called in the symbol field): register every channel
 * an operation can reach before invoking that entry.
 *
 * Instance semantics compose exactly like the sink's: under
 * `localize_runtime` the channel slots are per-archive (each instance owns
 * a private registration set); under `instance_per_thread` they are
 * per-instance THREAD-LOCAL state — a callback registered on thread T
 * fires only for T's instance, and each serving thread registers its own
 * channels before calling the init entry.
 *
 * Reentrancy is pinned like the sink's rule: a callback runs on the
 * calling thread, inside the entry's dynamic extent, and must NOT call
 * back into any library entry (the registration symbols included) or
 * unwind/longjmp across library frames — read the borrowed buffers, hand
 * the bytes to the embedder's own structures, return. The async_free
 * posture is unchanged: a channel adds no event loop, no threads, and no
 * reentry into the archive.
 *
 * Marshalling classes (design §4.2 + session ruling 3 + ask 4): f64, bool,
 * string, bytes for params and returns; u8/u32/i32 are PARAM-ONLY plumbing
 * classes; i64/u64 are ask-4's declared integer boundary classes (params:
 * wrapper range-check inbound, compile-time proof at internal call sites;
 * returns: prove-or-refuse over every value reaching them); void is
 * return-only. Unknown fields are refused at EVERY level the loader reads
 * — the root included (the anti-inert posture: profiles pin per compiler
 * release, so an unknown root key is a typo or a misplaced section, never
 * forward-compat surface; the ask-5 key names at the root refuse with a
 * pointer to their `determinism.*` home, since a silently inert `fences`
 * array is exactly the footgun the fence machinery refuses everywhere
 * else). Only the INTERIOR of `determinism` keeps a reserved-and-ignored
 * surface beyond the three ask-5 keys. */
