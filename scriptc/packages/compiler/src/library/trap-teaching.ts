/* The structured trap-teaching encoding (ratified 2026-07-23). A library-mode
 * sink message that carries a diagnostic code and/or the trapping symbol is
 * assembled as
 *
 *   0x01  text  0x1F code  0x1F symbol  [ 0x1F remediation ]
 *
 * The human teaching text LEADS the buffer so a plain-text host still shows
 * something useful; 0x01 (ASCII SOH) is the version marker — every baseline
 * (unstructured) message is UTF-8 whose first byte is printable, and no
 * emitter path may ever produce an unstructured message whose first byte is
 * below 0x20, so `msg_len > 0 && msg[0] == 0x01` identifies a structured
 * message unambiguously. Fields ride 0x1F (ASCII Unit Separator); the whole
 * remediation field, separator included, is absent when the profile supplies
 * none. Emitters MUST NOT append fields beyond these four under this marker;
 * parsers MUST ignore any field past the fourth.
 *
 * Division of labor (the spec's compatibility clause): the profile authors
 * teaching and remediation text, the COMPILER assembles the buffer here
 * (code, symbol, framing), and the runtime funnel and the host sink carry
 * the bytes opaque and unchanged — the sink signature (ctx, msg pointer,
 * len, address) is frozen; all structure lives in the message bytes.
 *
 * Code space: SC-prefixed codes belong exclusively to the compiler's
 * diagnostics registry; embedder-supplied codes are embedder-prefixed and
 * validated only as tokens free of the reserved bytes (profile.ts), never
 * for registry membership. */
