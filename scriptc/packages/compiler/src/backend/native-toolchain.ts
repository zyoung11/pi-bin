/* ── alternate C compiler (SCRIPTC_CC) and cross target (SCRIPTC_TARGET) ──────────
 * SCRIPTC_CC=zigcc swaps the compiler driver to `zig cc` (clang underneath, with
 * zig's bundled sysroots — the door to cross-compiling). Unset or
 * SCRIPTC_CC=clang is the default. Host Linux adds the two glibc requirements
 * that macOS does not need: -D_GNU_SOURCE while compiling, and -lm after all
 * link inputs. Other hosts keep the historical bare-clang command line.
 *
 * SCRIPTC_TARGET=<triple> (zigcc only — plain clang has no cross sysroots here)
 * adds `-target <triple>` to every compile. Linux triples also add
 * -D_GNU_SOURCE: glibc hides POSIX/GNU declarations (kill, realpath, stpcpy,
 * arc4random_buf, posix_spawn_file_actions_addchdir_np, ...) under plain
 * -std=c11, where macOS exposes everything by default. Musl triples additionally
 * carry SCR_MUSL because musl deliberately exposes no libc-identification macro;
 * the runtime uses it only for the narrow libc shim in scr_musl.c. Pin the glibc
 * minor in GNU triples (e.g. aarch64-linux-gnu.2.36) so the binary runs on the
 * differential container's distro (see tests/harness/linux-differential.test.ts).
 *
 * Fetch is NATIVE everywhere (scr_fetch.c over the socket units — no
 * libcurl), so it cross-compiles wherever net/http/tls do, win32
 * included. The retired curl reference (SCRIPTC_FETCH_CURL=1) keeps the
 * historical host -lcurl link and the linux-gnu import-STUB arm (soname
 * libcurl.so.4 — see ensureCurlStub). The event-loop units
 * (net/http/dgram/watch) cross-compile to Linux: the readiness poller is
 * the scr_platform.h contract with kqueue and epoll backends; libregexp,
 * zlib, mbedTLS, and the engine archive (--dynamic) build per target
 * (ensureLreObjects / ensureZlibObjects / ensureTlsArchive /
 * buildEngineArchiveDirect — host zlib builds still link the system libz,
 * byte-identically).
 * Windows triples (x86_64-windows-gnu, mingw-w64 headers and CRT via zig)
 * have no gates left: events, net/http, fetch, watch, zlib, dgram/dns,
 * tls, and the engine archive (--dynamic) all build per target through
 * their win32 arms (mbedTLS compiles unchanged for the triple — its own _WIN32
 * port covers entropy and timing; the TLS link adds bcrypt for
 * BCryptGenRandom, while the CA-store unit adds crypt32 for the Windows
 * system certificate stores).
 * They additionally compile
 * scr_win.c, the win32 libc shim TU (stpcpy, arc4random_buf — see the
 * _WIN32 block in scr_runtime.h), linking -ladvapi32 for its CSPRNG
 * (RtlGenRandom) and GetUserNameA. Native zigcc builds (no SCRIPTC_TARGET)
 * support everything: same platform, same archives, just a different
 * driver binary.
 * Mobile triples (aarch64-apple-ios, aarch64-apple-ios-simulator,

 * those in parallel, cache each object independently, then relocatably merge
 * them back into the archive's one canonical program member. A localized edit
 * recompiles only the changed buckets; exact repeats use the merged-object or
 * completed-archive tiers and never repeat the merge.
 * The base set narrows from the executable lane's unconditional sources:
 * scr_async.c (fibers, timers, the loop) and scr_child.c drop — the
 * async_free refusal already guarantees nothing references them — and
 * scr_library.c (sink, arena, reset registry, library funnel) joins. The gated
 * units a library may reach are the pure-data ones (regex + the vendored matcher, assert,

/* Multi-instance library mode's localization step: combine the program
 * object with exactly the runtime/vendor members it reaches into ONE
 * relocatable object, then demote every scriptc external definition except
 * the profile-declared symbols to a local symbol. The internals are not
 * renamed apart — they stop being visible to the embedder's linker at all,
 * so a second archive built under a different prefix brings its own private
 * copy of the whole runtime (allocator, collector, arena, panic sink) into
 * the same process. Undefined references (the target C/math runtime and
 * system APIs, plus sanitizer ABI in instrumented builds) keep their global
 * binding: those platform services and the sanitizer are the embedder's,
 * shared by design. Windows embedders additionally link advapi32, iphlpapi,
 * and ws2_32.
 *
 * The generated program and optional identity objects are mandatory roots;
 * support-member selection still matters. A classic archive's unused members (and their
 * undefined references to units library mode excludes, like the
 * fs-promises unit's fiber symbols) never reach an embedder's link. A
 * blind merge of every object would carry those references into the one
 * combined member. Staging the support objects into an intermediate
 * archive keeps the linker's own member semantics: `ld -r` pulls only the
 * members the program object transitively needs (the COFF arm implements
 * the same member semantics in process).
 *
 *   Mach-O — one host-ld64 invocation: -r merges roots + needed members,
 *            -exported_symbols_list demotes every unlisted global to
 *            private extern, and -r without -keep_private_externs writes
 *            private externs out as non-external symbols. Apple ASan's
 *            image-registration COMMON remains shared so the final Mach-O
 *            image registers its globals once. ld64 reads every Apple
 *            platform's objects — macOS architectures and the iOS/
 *            iOS-simulator triples alike (LC_BUILD_VERSION platform and
 *            minos survive the merge) — so darwin-host macos AND ios
 *            targets ride the same arm; compileLibrary refuses those
 *            targets elsewhere.
 *   ELF, native linux host — ld -r merges with --force-group-allocation
 *            (ASan's instrumented globals ride ELF section groups whose
 *            signatures repeat across archives sharing runtime objects;
 *            resolving the groups into the combined member keeps a later
 *            multi-archive link from discarding one archive's copies),
 *            then binutils objcopy --keep-global-symbols localizes every
 *            other DEFINED global (objcopy leaves undefined symbols
 *            global by its own rule). The exact historical recipe.
 *   ELF, cross triples from any host — `zig cc -target <triple> -r`
 *            merges (zig is already the cross driver's hard requirement),
 *            then localizeElfObject demotes in process and resolves
 *            section groups the way --force-group-allocation does, with
 *            no host binutils/llvm-objcopy dependency.
 *   COFF, native win32 hosts and windows cross triples from any host —
 *            mergeAndLocalizeCoffObjects performs member selection, the
 *            merge, cross-object symbol resolution, and demotion in
 *            process: no linker offers a COFF relocatable mode (lld-link
 *            mirrors MSVC link.exe; zig's COFF driver refuses multi-object
 *            merges) and llvm-objcopy rejects symbol-scope flags for
 *            COFF, so no tool pairing exists to shell out to. */

/* -------------------------- persistent build cache ---------------------------
 * Content-addressed caches that let repeat builds of unchanged programs skip
 * payload code generation/linking — the test lanes' dominant cost. Executable
 * lookups still run lightweight dependency and link-input metadata probes.
 * Principal keyspaces under the cache root:
 *
 *   bin/<key>       — whole program binaries. key = sha256(resolved clang
 *                     identity/version, target + compiler/linker environment,
 *                     effective driver invocations for the real build flags,
 *                     implicit system-header and resolved linker-input bytes,
 *                     linker/assembler identities, runtime fingerprint
 *                     (every .c/.h in the runtime src dir plus the vendor pin
 *                     QJS_COMMIT), the caller's dependency identity, the
 *                     compiler-visible TU path, Darwin output basename, the
 *                     FULL normalized command line, and the emitted C bytes).
 *                     Emitted C is
 *                     byte-stable by project invariant, so unchanged programs
 *                     hit; any flag difference — e.g. the sanitized lane's
 *                     -O1/-fsanitize=address/-DSCR_RC_AUDIT — lands in a
 *                     naturally distinct key. On a hit the cached binary is
 *                     copied and atomically renamed onto outPath (never an
 *                     in-place overwrite — see the hit path) after its digest
 *                     is verified; the binary is still EXECUTED live by whoever
 *                     asked for it, so no comparison or sanitizer coverage
 *                     is ever skipped.
 *
 *   lib/<key>       — whole library archives. The identity covers the resolved
 *                     compiler and archiver identities/versions, compiler/linker
 *                     environment, effective build-flavor driver invocations,
 *                     implicit toolchain inputs, runtime fingerprint,
 *                     target/flags, gated source set, caller dependency
 *                     identity, TU path, and program-TU bytes.
 *                     Checksum-verified hits skip native code generation and ar.
 *
 *   program-obj/<key> — the canonical library program object, after any LLVM
 *                     shard merge. Exact TU repeats reuse it directly.
 *
 *   program-shard/<key> — stable LLVM dev-library buckets keyed by their IR
 *                     text and complete toolchain/TU identity. Local edits
 *                     retain every bucket whose definitions/declarations did
 *                     not change.
 *
 *   obj/<set>/<f>.o — per-flavor runtime objects for cache-miss builds. The
 *                     historical single invocation recompiles every runtime
 *                     TU per program (~1.3s at -O2); with cached objects a
 *                     miss compiles ONLY the program's C and links (~0.15s).
 *                     Library-mode -DSCR_LIB objects use a distinct flavor.
 *                     The clang driver hands every input the same option set,
 *                     so per-TU `-c` compiles with those options plus a final
 *                     link reproduce the single invocation exactly; the
 *                     driver's effective invocation under that flavor also
 *                     joins the object-set identity. Every
 *                     cached object carries a verified digest. Object
 *                     compiles go through ccache when it is installed (silent
 *                     fallback when not).
 *
 * Frontend-generated production builds supply a dependency identity and use a
 * per-user platform cache by default. Arbitrary low-level TUs omit the identity
 * and bypass this cache because their include graph is caller-owned.
 * Compiler wrappers also bypass every persistent tier: a wrapper can branch on
 * the real source/object topology and inject inputs no synthetic probe sees.
 * Direct Clang/Zig drivers and Apple's immutable /usr/bin/clang handoff retain
 * caching; wrapper-driven builds use private, invocation-local vendor outputs.
 * Opaque archiver wrappers bypass completed library archives for the same
 * reason while retaining safely keyed runtime objects.
 * Builds with caller-supplied native link inputs (archive/object paths or
 * `-l<name>` libraries) also bypass the whole binary cache: a thin archive,
 * linker script, or ambient resolution can change transitively without
 * changing the named input's bytes or spelling. Their runtime objects remain
 * cached, and every invocation performs the final link against current inputs.
 * SCRIPTC_CACHE_DIR overrides the root (the test lanes use this to stay
 * repo-local); an explicitly empty value or SCRIPTC_NO_CACHE=1 disables reads
 * and writes. With caching disabled compileC issues the exact historical
 * command line.
 *
 * Eviction: size-capped LRU over the whole cache root (SCRIPTC_CACHE_MAX_MB,
 * default 4096). Explicit caps are checked after every successful write; the
 * large default is swept on the first and every 64th write so corpus/watch
 * loops do not repeatedly walk a growing tree. Reads bump mtimes. The harness's
 * oracle cache lives under the same root and is swept by the same pass. Cache
 * trouble is never a build failure — every cache error falls back to a real
 * compile. */
