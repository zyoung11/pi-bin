/* The npm RUNTIME graph: what --dynamic builds embed.
 *
 * Types come from the package's shipped .d.ts (program.ts resolves those
 * through TypeScript itself); the CODE that runs is the package's shipped
 * JS, resolved HERE at build time with Node's own resolution algorithm —
 * for every (importer, specifier) pair, node_modules directories are
 * probed from the importing FILE upward to the filesystem root, symlinks
 * are resolved with realpath (pnpm/bun virtual stores are symlink farms —
 * a package's dependencies live next to its REAL location, not its link),
 * package.json "exports" maps are honored (import/require conditions,
 * subpath patterns with '*'), with main/module fallbacks and extension/
 * directory-index resolution for the rest. The internal module graph
 * (the package's own relative imports/requires plus its dependencies')
 * is scanned with a real TypeScript parse collecting every module edge —
 * import/export declarations (including `export * as ns from`, which
 * ts.preProcessFile silently drops), dynamic import() of string literals,
 * and CommonJS require() calls — never a regex.
 *
 * Every reached module's SOURCE is embedded into the emitted C as a static
 * string keyed by its REALPATH — one physical module embeds once, however
 * many symlink aliases reach it; scr_island.c serves the engine's module
 * loader (and a CommonJS require shim) from that map, so binaries never
 * read node_modules at runtime. Each CommonJS module additionally embeds a
 * synthesized ESM FACADE — default plus the named exports lexed from its
 * source with the compiler's quirk-faithful port of Node's vendored CJS
 * lexer (cjs-lexer.ts, the merve port program.ts also answers with) — so
 * ES modules inside the graph named-import CJS files exactly like under
 * Node, including the failures: a name Node's lexer cannot see is absent
 * from the facade and the embedded import fails at engine link time just
 * as Node's instantiate would.
 * Node builtins are NOT embedded: the island
 * ships shims for the set CLIs actually drive — the pure-JS tier (util,
 * assert, buffer, string_decoder, querystring, punycode, console, timers,
 * readline, async_hooks' two classes, events, module, tty) and the host
 * bridges riding the same C implementations the static lowerings use
 * (fs + fs/promises, path both families, url's WHATWG parser and file
 * converters, crypto's hashing/random slice, zlib, process, os) — the
 * worker_threads tier stays unshimmed (SHIMMED_BUILTINS is
 * the source of truth).
 *
 * EDGE-KIND SEMANTICS match Node's per kind, TRANSITIVELY. A STATIC
 * import/export edge in an eagerly-reached module is EAGER — Node links the
 * whole static graph before anything evaluates — so a static edge that
 * reaches an unshimmed builtin or does not resolve is a build-time
 * diagnostic naming the builtin/specifier, the requiring package, and the
 * dependency chain that reached it. A require() or dynamic import() edge is
 * LAZY — Node fails require at the CALL and import() at evaluation — and so
 * is EVERY edge of a module only reachable through lazy edges: Node links
 * that whole subgraph at the boundary call (a CLI's launcher shim
 * import()s its real CLI, so the CLI graph's own static imports fail at
 * that import(), never sooner). A blocked lazy edge embeds a runtime trap
 * instead of failing the build:
 * an unshimmed builtin keeps the island's own lazy throw (the edge embeds
 * pointing at the "node:x" key the shim table refuses at the call), an
 * unresolvable require() gets Node's MODULE_NOT_FOUND shape from the
 * island's require shim (message carrying the live Require stack, code,
 * requireStack — NO edge embeds; the shim owns the throw), and an
 * unresolvable import() embeds a throwing ESM stub with Node's
 * ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND shape (the addDynamicImport
 * ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION stub's pattern). Blocked-but-lazy edges stay in
 * the build-time inventory (builtins/lazyTraps) so the coverage report says
 * exactly what the binary cannot reach. esbuild-published bundles route
 * external requires through a `__require` helper; its literal call sites
 * collect as require edges too, so esbuild dists get the same honest
 * build-time inventory. A specifier that RESOLVES to a .node native addon
 * embeds a throwing ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED stub instead of the addon's machine
 * code (the island has no process.dlopen; napi binding packages require()
 * their .node lazily next to a fallback, so the stub is the "addon
 * missing" path they already handle) — those keep an inventory row too
 * (lazyTraps, native: true).
 *
 * CONDITION SETS come from the CALL FORM, never the importer's format —
 * Node resolves import/export declarations and import() with
 * ["node","import"] and require() with ["node","require"] — so a DUAL
 * package (smol-toml's shape: "exports" whose "import" and "require"
 * conditions name different files) embeds BOTH entries, each behind its
 * own kind-tagged edge; the island's module loader looks edges up with
 * the import kind, its require shim with the require kind (the dual-
 * package hazard included: the two entries are distinct module
 * instances, exactly Node). And a require edge ATTRIBUTES to the module
 * whose scope defines the require function being called: esbuild's
 * `__require` lives in a shared chunk whose banner createRequire it
 * closed over, so a call site in ANOTHER chunk resolves — at build time
 * here and at runtime in Node — from the DEFINING chunk, and the edge
 * lives under its key (requireHelperOriginOf follows the import and
 * re-export hops).
