/* The checker facade: 5.9.3-shaped TypeChecker methods over 7.0.2's sync
 * client, built around the survey's feasibility verdict. Naive per-call use
 * of the 7.0.2 client costs 0.1-0.3 ms of IPC per query; the census counted
 * 32,226 checker calls lowering mock-gateway, so a transparent adapter would
 * add seconds. Batched, the same queries run at ~0.005 ms/call — parity with
 * 5.9.3. Three mechanisms make batching and reuse the DEFAULT path:
 *
 * 1. IDENTITY MEMOS. One WeakMap per query kind, keyed on the client-side
 *    node/type/symbol object. Safe because the 7.0.2 client registry dedupes
 *    by server handle id (probe-verified: the same symbol/type from any two
 *    queries is the same object), and a snapshot is immutable — an answer
 *    never changes for the life of the program. The client itself does NOT
 *    memoize (warm re-query of 21 nodes costs 2.5-3.8 ms; the survey's
 *    finding), so this layer is where reuse lives.
 *
 * 2. PHASE-AWARE BATCH PREFETCH. Ordinary callers keep the whole-file
 *    first-miss fallback, but the compiler explicitly batches declaration
 *    headers, top-level code, and each newly reachable body wave. Managed
 *    files then use direct memoized misses instead of accidentally sweeping
 *    every unreachable body. prefetchSourceFile() retains the whole-file
 *    escape hatch. Symbol prefetch also batch-fetches getTypeOfSymbol over
 *    every symbol each batch surfaces (5,333 calls of the mock-gateway
 *    census ride that pattern).
 *
 * 3. CLIENT-SIDE FAST PATHS. getBaseTypeOfLiteralType — the census's single
 *    hottest method (9,059 calls on mock-gateway) — is answered locally from
 *    type.flags plus the intrinsic-type singletons for the literal kinds
 *    5.9.3 maps to intrinsics (string/number/bigint/boolean literals), with
 *    IPC only for enum-ish and union types. isTupleType answers shape-true
 *    and non-object-false locally; isArrayType likewise answers
 *    non-object-false locally. Both round-trip (memoized) only where object
 *    identity needs the checker. Immutable union/intersection constituents
 *    are memoized too because TypeScript 7's Type.getTypes() otherwise
 *    repeats an IPC request. All paths are verified against the raw checker
 *    and against 5.9.3 by the adapter's suites. */
