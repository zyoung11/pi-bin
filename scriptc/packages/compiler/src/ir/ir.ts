 * - Plain JSON-safe discriminated unions: no classes, no parent pointers,
 *   no cycles. Cross-references are by string id.
 * - Every node carries `loc` (source span) and every expression carries its
 *   computed `type` — backends never re-derive types.
 * - Structured control flow (statement tree), not basic blocks: the only
 * current backend is C and there are no optimization passes yet. When a mid-end
 *   arrives, a structured→CFG lowering pass slots in after validation.
 * - The type union is deliberately written for extension (`dyn` shipped
 *   with JSON, `promise` with async). All switches over IrType/IrExpr/
 *   IrStmt must have exhaustive `never` default arms so adding a member
 *   turns into compile errors, not silent misbehavior.

/** The typed-array/Buffer method surface (bytesIntrinsic). Receiver/arg

 * 0–2 f64 relative indices (omitted args are OMITTED from `args`, like
 * strIntrinsic — backends fill start 0 / end +Infinity) → a fresh
 * same-elem bytes COPY; `subarray` takes the same 0–2 f64 relative
 * indices → a same-elem VIEW aliasing the receiver's storage (JS's
 * TypedArray.prototype.subarray; Buffer's slice(), subarray's deprecated
 * Node alias, lowers here too — only plain typed arrays' slice copies);
 * `setFrom` (`dst.set(src, offset?)`) takes a
 * same-elem bytes src and an optional f64 offset (omitted = 0) → void,
 * THROWS Node's RangeError on overflow (may-throw seed); `toString` takes
 * one canonical literal encoding arg (the frontend completes omitted or
 * undefined to "utf8"; u8 receivers only) → owned +1 string, never
 * throws; `toStringVar` has the same signature for runtime-valued
 * BufferEncoding arguments, normalizes aliases/case, and throws
 * ERR_UNKNOWN_ENCODING for an invalid cast; the numeric families (u8
 * receivers only) carry their KIND as args[0], always a strLit the
 * backend maps to the runtime's tag: `readNum` [kind, offset] /
 * `writeNum` [kind, value, offset] cover the fixed widths (kind "u8",
 * "i8", then "u16be"/"u16le"-style width+endian tokens through "f64le");
 * `readNumVar` [kind, offset, byteLength] / `writeNumVar` [kind, value,
 * offset, byteLength] are the variable-width read/writeUIntLE family
 * (kind "ube"/"ule"/"ibe"/"ile"). All four THROW Node's RangeErrors on
 * bad values/offsets/byteLengths (may-throw seeds); writes return
 * offset + width. Receivers and args are BORROWED; refcounted
 * results are owned (+1).
 *
 * The DataView surface rides the same node (DataView maps to bytes<u8> —
 * at runtime a borrowed VIEW aliasing its owner's storage, so no aliasing
 * divergence exists): `byteOffset` is a property read → f64 (0 for owners,
 * the view's offset for a DataView); `dataViewNew` (`new
 * DataView(x.buffer, byteOffset?, byteLength?)`) takes the BYTES value x
 * as the receiver (the frontend peels the syntactic `.buffer`) and 0–2
 * f64 args (omitted args OMITTED, like slice) → a fresh bytes<u8> view
 * retaining x's owner, THROWS Node's RangeErrors on bad indices; the
 * `dvGet*` getters take one f64 byte offset plus, on the multi-byte kinds,
 * an optional bool littleEndian (omitted = big-endian, the JS default) →
 * f64, THROWING Node's constant "Offset is outside the bounds of the
 * DataView" RangeError on any bad offset. `dvGetBigUint64Number`/
 * `dvGetBigInt64Number` are the COMPOSED `Number(view.getBigUint64(...))`
 * lowerings — the bare bigint-returning calls are fenced, the wrapped
 * form converts the 8-byte integer to double exactly as Number(bigint).
 * The `dvSet*` setters mirror the getters: [offset, value] plus the
 * optional bool littleEndian on the multi-byte kinds → void, the same

 * (integer kinds by modular truncation, Float32 by double→float
