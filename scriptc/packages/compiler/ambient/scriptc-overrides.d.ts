 * rejected over an override-manufactured error; the affected sites meet the
 * lowerer's honest fences instead (SC1100's checked-cast family for
 * JSON.parse results, the executor fences for Promise shapes). The
 * primitives every world needs (comptime, setTimeout, __island_eval) live
 * in scriptc.d.ts, which ships to BOTH programs. */
