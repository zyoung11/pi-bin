/* scriptc's shipped declarations — the ALWAYS-SHIPPED CORE. Programs
 * compile against the REAL TypeScript standard library (lib.es2023, no
 * dyn, no @types): the checker sees the full standard surface, and the
 * LOWERER is the scope fence — any reached use of standard-library surface
 * without a lowering is a SC2020 diagnostic at its use site. This file
 * declares only what the es2023 lib does not:
 *
 * 1. scriptc's own primitives (comptime, __island_eval).
 * 2. setTimeout/clearTimeout and the Timeout handle (Node/dyn territory the
 *    lib files don't cover; plain declarations, so with @types/node present
 *    they MERGE as overloads instead of colliding — the Timeout handle maps
 *    to the numeric timer id either way, and .unref()/.ref()/.hasRef() are
 *    loop-liveness bookkeeping).
 *
 * This file ships to EVERY program scriptc builds — the lowering program
 * and preflight's project-world second-chance program alike (a project
 * using comptime must typecheck in both). The divergence/precision
 * overrides (JSON.parse(): unknown, pop(): T, the Promise executor shape,
 * ...) live in scriptc-overrides.d.ts, which joins the LOWERING program only.
 *
 * console, process, and the "node:fs" module live in scriptc-node-fallback.d.ts,
 * shipped ONLY when the target project has no @types/node — with it, the
 * project's real Node types are the type surface and the fallback stands
 * down (its `declare const`/`declare module` forms would collide). The
 * lowering tables recognize the same members either way, by name +
 * provenance. */

/* The timer handle — setTimeout's return, mapped to the numeric timer id.
 * unref() drops it from the event loop's keep-alive set (the process may
 * exit with the timer still armed — it never fires then, exactly Node);
 * ref() restores it; hasRef() reports the state. The methods return the
 * handle for chaining. Under @types/node this MERGES with NodeJS.Timeout
 * (both map to the same numeric handle). */

 * literal — numbers (finite), strings, booleans, arrays, and records,
