/* ── cycle collection (scr_cycle.c) ───────────────────────────────────
 * Reference counting alone cannot free cycles, so every object that can
 * participate in one — capture boxes, heap closures, unions, promises, and
 * compiler-emitted class/record shapes with cycle-capable fields — is
 * allocated with a hidden header directly BEFORE the object: a trace
 * function (enumerates the object's cycle-capable children), a teardown
 * function (frees the object WITHOUT releasing traced children), and the
 * trial-deletion bookkeeping (color + candidate-root buffer state). Types
 * that can never be in a cycle — strings above all, plus arrays of scalar/
 * string/bytes elements, dyn trees, and shapes whose fields are all acyclic
 * — keep the lean 1-word `rc` header and pay nothing. Arrays and maps are
 * cycle-capable exactly when their element/value type is (a record element
 * can point back at the array holding it).
 *
 * The collector is synchronous Bacon–Rajan trial deletion: a release that
 * leaves a candidate's rc above zero buffers it as a possible cycle root;
 * collection walks the buffer (markGray: trial-decrement internal edges;
 * scan: restore externally-referenced subgraphs; collectWhite: free the
 * dead cycle members, releasing only edges that LEAVE the white set).
 * It is GENERATIONAL: each header carries a generation, a pass names the
 * oldest one it will walk, and objects that survive a pass are promoted out
 * of the nursery so later nursery passes never re-walk them. That is what
 * keeps a pass proportional to recent allocation rather than to the whole
 * live heap — see the generation note in scr_cycle.c for the soundness
 * argument and the schedule. Collection points: program exit (before the RC
 * audit), event-loop quiescence, and the per-generation triggers.
 * SCR_CYCLE_THRESHOLD pins the nursery trigger to a fixed candidate count.
 * There is no concurrent or incremental collection.
 *
 * Contract for trace/teardown pairs (the compiler emits them for shapes,
 * the runtime owns its own): trace(obj) visits exactly the strong
 * references to children that themselves carry a cycle header (visit
 * callbacks tolerate NULL and immortal children); the teardown releases
 * exactly the complement (strings, arrays, acyclic shapes), frees internal
 * buffers, and frees the block via scr_cyc_free. Every heap object's
 * FIRST member is `size_t rc`, which is what lets the collector adjust

 * are visited (they append), deleted entries are skipped (tombstones), and
 * a delete + re-add moves the key to the end (Node-verified).
 *
 * Keys are string (content) or number with SameValueZero: NaN equals NaN
 * (canonicalized before hashing) and -0 is normalized to +0 at insertion,
 * exactly like JS (a stored -0 key reads back as +0). Hash is FNV-1a over
 * the string bytes / the canonicalized f64 bit pattern.
 *
 * Values are one uniform kind per map (like ScrArr elements): f64, bool, or
 * a refcounted pointer whose RC entry points arrive as function pointers at
 * construction (the SCR_BOX_OBJ technique — the runtime cannot know
 * per-class/per-record layouts). val_trace is non-NULL exactly when the
 * value type carries a cycle header: such maps are CYCLE-CAPABLE (a record/
 * object value can point back at the map holding it) and allocate with the
 * hidden collector header — their trace visits every live value, and the
 * collector teardown releases the complement (keys). Scalar-, string- and
 * array-valued maps keep the lean 1-word header (none of those can point
 * back at an owner).
 *
 * Ownership: set BORROWS the key (the map retains string keys it stores)
 * and OWNS the value (+1 moves in; replacing releases the old value).
 * get/has/delete borrow the key; get returns +1 on ref values (NULL = not
 * found) or fills an out-param and returns a found flag for scalars.
 * delete releases the entry's key and value. iter_key_str and iter_val_ref

 * preorder-interval membership under a runtime stream vtable (main()
 * stamps the intervals, the emitter-vt story).

 * Event timing: Node defers most stream emissions by a process.nextTick.
 * Here those deferrals ride a dedicated TICK QUEUE drained at the top of
 * every loop turn (before the events/net/timer stations — the closest
 * station to nextTick; SEMANTICS.md documents the microtask-order
 * divergence), registered via scr_loop_set_stream at install. Emits run
 * user code synchronously on the dispatching stack and may leave an
 * exception pending, exactly like scr_emitter_emit — an unhandled
 * 'error' event throws its payload (Node's crash).
 *
 * Ownership: constructors take their option callbacks +1 (moves);
 * chunks are BORROWED at push/write (the buffer retains its copy);
 * chaining forms return the receiver +1; read()/errored answer +1 or

 * and sets the pending flag; the COMPILER emits a pending check after every call that can throw
 * and unwinds by releasing its frames/scopes and returning a dummy value —
 * no setjmp/longjmp (longjmp would skip the emitted RC releases). A `catch`

 * bindingless, so the payload is released, not read); an exception still
 * pending when the entry function returns is uncaught: main prints it to
 * stderr and exits 1 (Node's uncaught exit code).
 *
 * Ref payloads carry their RC entry points as function pointers, exactly
 * like ScrUnion/SCR_BOX_OBJ: the runtime cannot know per-class/per-record
 * struct layouts. A throw while an exception is already pending REPLACES it
 * (the old payload is released) — that is JS's behavior for a throw inside
 * a `finally` running on the exception path.

 * A generator is a refcounted handle (ScrGen) over a fiber created
 * SUSPENDED — nothing runs until the first resume — plus three
 * type-erased value slots (kind + payload + release fn, the exception
 * cell's technique): OUT (the yielded value, or the completion value once
 * done), IN (the `.next(v)` argument), and RET (a parked `.return(v)`
 * value, promoted to OUT by the trampoline when the GENRET unwind
 * completes). The emitted code is type-directed: setters/takes move
 * ownership (+1 in, +1 out); a NONE slot is JS's undefined.
 *
 * Resume protocol (consumer side, synchronous — no event loop):
 * - scr_gen_resume: `.next()`. Starts or resumes the fiber and returns
 *   when it yields or completes. A body exception (or an injected
 *   `.throw`) moves into the CALLER's cell — the emitted pending check
 *   after the resume propagates it. Resuming a RUNNING generator throws
 *   Node's TypeError; resuming a DONE one is a no-op (OUT stays NONE —
 *   `{ value: undefined, done: true }`).
 * - scr_gen_resume_return: `.return(v)` with v already parked in RET.
 *   UNSTARTED/DONE: the body never runs (the unstarted fiber tears down,
 *   its argpack dropped); RET promotes to OUT. SUSPENDED: the GENRET
 *   sentinel enters the fiber's cell and the fiber resumes — finallys
 *   run; a finally that YIELDS parks the sentinel (done stays false; a
 *   later resume continues the unwind); a finally that THROWS replaces it.
 * - scr_gen_resume_throw: `.throw(e)` with e pending in the CALLER's cell
 *   (the emitted scr_throw_* just ran). SUSPENDED: the payload moves into
 *   the fiber's cell and the fiber resumes — the body's own try/catch
 *   sees it. UNSTARTED/DONE: the generator becomes done and the payload
 *   stays pending in the caller (the `.throw` call itself throws).
 *
 * Abandonment: releasing a SUSPENDED generator leaks its fiber
 * deliberately (unwinding would run user finallys Node's GC never runs);
 * the fiber stays in the live count, so programs that abandon one get the
 * abandoned-fiber RC-audit note (the loop-exhaustion story). An UNSTARTED
 * generator tears down cleanly: drop_args releases the packed arguments.
