/* Reference-cycle collector: generational Bacon–Rajan trial deletion (see
 * "Concurrent Cycle Collection in Reference Counted Systems", the
 * synchronous algorithm) over cycle-headered objects only — the object
 * model and the trace/teardown contract live in scr_runtime.h.
 *
 * Life of a candidate: a release that leaves rc > 0 buffers the object
 * (purple). Collection walks the buffer in three phases over the graph
 * reachable from it:
 *   markGray     trial-delete: decrement rc once per internal edge;
 *   scan         nodes still rc > 0 are externally referenced — re-blacken
 *                their subgraph and restore the trial decrements;
 *   collectWhite everything left white is a dead cycle: free it, releasing
 *                only edges that LEAVE the white set (each member's
 *                teardown releases its untraced children; traced edges were
 *                already accounted by markGray).
 * The white set is gathered first and freed after the walk — freeing
 * during the walk would leave dangling sibling edges for later visits.
 *
 * Correctness leans on two global invariants (docs/memory.md):
 * - every strong reference is counted: stacks, locals, and runtime-owned
 *   buffers (timer callbacks, unhandled-rejection tracking) all hold +1,
 *   so trial deletion can never free something a root still reaches;
 * - mutators unlink before they release: a heap object's stored pointer is
 *   overwritten BEFORE the old value's release runs, so a threshold
 *   collection triggered inside that release never sees an edge whose
 *   count was already given up (which would over-decrement and free live
 *   data).
 *
 * Recursion depth equals the traced structure's depth — same property as
 * the existing recursive releases (deep lists recurse deeply; acceptable
 * for now, revisit with an explicit stack if it ever traps).
 *
 * ── generations ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A pass costs O(objects reachable from its candidates), and a candidate
 * deep in a live structure reaches all of it — so collecting on a fixed
 * candidate count makes total work QUADRATIC in a growing live heap. A
 * splay tree is the worst case: re-linking a node buffers it, the walk
 * from it drags in every node below, and none of it is ever garbage.
 *
 * So the collector is generational, in the shape CPython uses for this
 * same algorithm. Each header carries a `gen`; a pass names the oldest
 * generation it will walk and SKIPS every object above it, exactly as it
 * skips NULL and immortals. Objects that survive a pass are promoted, so
 * the next nursery pass never walks them again: the cost of a nursery pass
 * is proportional to what has been allocated since the last one, not to
 * the live heap.
 *
 * Restricting the walk stays sound because trial deletion is already
 * conservative in the right direction. An edge from a skipped (older)
 * object into the walked set is never trial-deleted, so its target keeps
 * that count, reads as externally referenced, and survives — the same
 * answer the collector gives for a reference held by the stack. Edges the
 * other way are simply not followed; the older object was not a candidate
 * for freeing in this pass. What this gives up is cycles that SPAN
 * generations: those are invisible to a nursery pass and are found by the
 * full pass, which walks every generation and so is exactly the old
 * algorithm.
 *
 * Scheduling. One counter drives the release path: candidates buffered
 * since the last pass. When it trips, the pass runs at the nursery level
 * unless either full-pass condition holds:
 *   heap growth    the live cycle-headered heap is a fraction past its size
 *                  after the last full pass — the standard mature-generation
 *                  rule, which catches garbage made from fresh allocation;
 *   mature backlog the mature candidate buffer has reached a fraction of the
 *                  live heap. This one is not redundant: live data that is
 *                  unlinked INTO a dead cycle grows no counter at all (it
 *                  was tallied when it was allocated) and is invisible to a
 *                  nursery pass, so without it a program that churns its
 *                  long-lived structures would never collect anything.
 *   scheduled age  a mature candidate has waited through a nursery's worth
 *                  of event-loop checkpoints. Candidate COUNT cannot bound
 *                  the garbage behind one root, and an idle heap does not
 *                  trip growth, so this keeps a sparse mature backlog from
 *                  floating forever without putting a full walk on every
 *                  turn.
 * The first two bound collection work to a constant factor of mutator work —
 * one heap-sized walk per live/N candidates — while the scheduled age is the
 * liveness backstop, limiting its forced full walks to one per nursery's worth
 * of checkpoints while mature roots wait. That is the trade: a fixed root
 * threshold bounds floating garbage tightly and pays unbounded time for it;
 * this bounds ordinary mutator-triggered work and lets garbage float in
 * proportion, but not forever.

 * while the target keeps the count: a phantom reference that reads as an
