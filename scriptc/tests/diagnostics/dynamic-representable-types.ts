/* COMPOSITE types the dynamic engine represents but the static surface
 * does not — `any[]`, records and functions with `any`-typed members, the
 * evolving `const arr = []`: each site reports the SC2011 dynamic-family
 * choice ("runs in the embedded dynamic engine"), proved by re-running the
 * type mapping with the engine enabled — never the generic supported-types
 * recitation. Bare `any` keeps its own SC2011 arm (the stronger stay-static
 * hint: 'unknown' + a checked cast); types with NO dynamic representation
 * (an optional-element tuple) keep the SC2001 recitation. */
