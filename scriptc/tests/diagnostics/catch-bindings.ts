// under a proven narrow, rethrow, and the unknown-slot CONVERSION (an
// un-narrowed use typed `unknown` converts to a dynamic value — corpus
// 1554; `const copy = e` compiles now and is NOT in this fence corpus).
// Everything else must terminate in a clean fence — never a silent
// mis-read of the payload.
