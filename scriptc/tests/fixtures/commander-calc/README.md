# commander-calc fixture

The npm-dependency acceptance test: `calc.ts` is a calculator CLI built on
the real `commander` package, compiled with `--dynamic` and byte-compared
against Node across argv fixtures (tests/harness/npm.test.ts).

The vendored `node_modules` is committed test data on purpose — the test
must exercise a real published package, pinned:

- commander 14.0.0 (MIT license — see node_modules/commander/LICENSE)

To bump: `npm install --save-exact commander@<version>` in this directory,
then re-run the harness (Node remains the oracle, so no golden files need
updating).
