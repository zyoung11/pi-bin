// synthesized-function parameters; CALLS of such identifiers transport
// as calls and run engine-side at their pattern position — keys in
// pattern order, defaults lazily (the destructuringEvaluationOrder
// corpus's contract) — and a default may reference a name bound by an
// EARLIER element of the same pattern (the engine's mid-pattern scope
// IS JS's).
