/* Reachability's build contract — scriptc-only, deliberately NOT
 * differential:
 *
 * - The dead-strip side (a program importing a module whose UNUSED exports
 *   hold rejected constructs must build and run) is covered differentially
 *   by tests/corpus/420-dead-strip-modules. Here the same program's emitted
 *   C is grepped: an unreached body leaves NO trace — no function, no async
 *   spawn wrapper, no generic instance.
 * - The failure side cannot be differential (Node runs the "reached"
 *   variants fine): the SAME constructs, reached, must fail the build with
 *   exactly the diagnostics they always produced.
