/* The node:test differential — fixtures under tests/fixtures/node-test
 * run under Node AND compiled, stdout and exit codes compared with ONE
 * documented normalization applied to BOTH lanes. Node's spec reporter
 * embeds real durations in every line, so raw byte-compare is impossible
 * for ANY node:test program (which is why these are fixtures here, not
 * corpus entries); everything else — result lines, symbols, indentation,
 * # SKIP/# TODO directives, ℹ diagnostics, the summary block, the
 * failing-tests section's "test at file:line:col" and error MESSAGE
 * lines — must match byte-exactly.
 *
 * NORMALIZATIONS (both lanes):
 *   - "(1.234ms)" duration parentheticals → "(Xms)"
 *   - the "ℹ duration_ms N" summary line → "ℹ duration_ms X"
 *   - stack frames ("    at ...") and the inspect property block a frame
 *     opens ("... {" through its closing "}") are dropped — Node prints
 *     its runner-internal frames and an error-property dump the compiled
 *     runtime deliberately omits (SEMANTICS.md).
 *
 * Fixtures never console.log inside test bodies or hooks: Node's
 * reporter stream lags console output RACILY (its ordering varies run to
 * run under Node alone), while the compiled runtime reports
 * synchronously — mixed programs cannot be byte-compared against any
 * oracle. The `// @exit:` first line documents the expected exit code
 * and is asserted against BOTH lanes. SCRIPTC_SAN=1 rebuilds with ASan +
 * the RC audit over every case. */
