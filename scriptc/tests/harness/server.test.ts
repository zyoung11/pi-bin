/* The LISTENING-process differential: net/http server fixtures run under
 * Node AND compiled, and a shared per-case CLIENT DRIVER (a Node script,
 * identical for both lanes) talks to whichever lane is up. Nothing about
 * a listening program can be compared from stdout alone — the driver IS
 * the workload — so the contract has three legs, each byte-exact between
 * lanes: the SERVER program's stdout, the SERVER's exit code, and the
 * DRIVER's stdout.
 *
 * The port protocol: a fixture that listens binds port 0 and reports the
 * real port on STDERR as `PORT <n>` (stderr is never compared, so
 * ephemeral ports stay out of every compared stream); the harness waits
 * for that line, runs `node driver.mjs <port>`, and the fixture is
 * expected to shut itself down when the driver's conversation ends
 * (close the server, let the loop drain). Driver-less fixtures (pure
 * client programs: connect-refused shapes) skip the protocol and run
 * like corpus programs; refused-connection fixtures probe their own
 * ephemeral port (bind 0, close, connect) since a static build has no
 * string→number conversion for an argv port.
 *
 * SCRIPTC_SAN=1 rebuilds with ASan + the RC audit: socket/server handle
 * hygiene runs over every case. This file is the template the TLS and
 * http2 lanes inherit (the design note atop scr_net.c has the story). */
