/* Within-file partitioning for the corpus-driven harnesses.
 *
 * vitest's --shard is FILE-granular, and this suite's wall time is dominated
 * by a few monster files (differential.test.ts iterates the whole corpus
 * sequentially in one worker), so a naive file shard leaves one shard nearly
 * as slow as the whole suite. CI therefore sets SCRIPTC_TEST_SHARD="i/n"
 * alongside --shard=i/n, and every harness that globs a big case list runs
 * it through shardSelect below: small files distribute by file, monster
 * files split by case.
 *
 * The assignment hashes each case's stable NAME — never its list index — so
 * a program keeps its shard when the corpus grows around it (compile caches
 * stay warm across corpus additions) and, since the hash maps every key to
 * exactly one shard in [1..n], the union of the n shards runs every case
 * exactly once by construction (shard.test.ts pins the property). Unset =
 * everything: local runs are unchanged.
