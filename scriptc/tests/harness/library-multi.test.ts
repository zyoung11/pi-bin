/* Multi-instance library mode (the profile's abi.localize_runtime): N
 * library archives built under pairwise-distinct symbol prefixes link into
 * ONE process. The archive build combines the program, runtime, and vendor
 * objects into one relocatable member and demotes every external
 * definition except the profile-declared symbols to a local symbol, so the
 * embedder's linker sees no runtime internals at all — no symbol
 * collisions, and each instance owns a private copy of the whole runtime
 * (allocator, collector, result arena, panic sink, poison flag).
 *
 *   M1 symbols-exact     nm over a localized archive: the external defined
 *                        set equals the profile-declared set EXACTLY (plus
 *                        ASan's one image-registration common in a
 *                        sanitized build), and undefineds stay target-
 *                        runtime/system-API-shaped apart from sanitizer ABI
 *                        references
 *   M2 two-instance run  the acceptance probe: two archives (ma_/mb_), two
 *                        embedder threads (one per instance — the
 *                        documented contract), independent init and
 *                        collect, a deliberate trap in A delivered to A's
 *                        sink exactly once (structured: SC4014, ma_boom,
 *                        A's ctx) while B keeps answering through and after
 *                        the trap window; B's sink never fires. Runs per
 *                        emission and once with mixed emissions (one
 *                        archive per backend).
 *   M3 profile shape     abi.localize_runtime is strictly boolean (SC4001)
 *   M4 target posture    localization is per OBJECT FORMAT: ELF and COFF
 *                        localize from any host, Mach-O runs the macOS
 *                        host linker — so a macos target off a darwin
 *                        host, and any host outside darwin/linux/win32,
 *                        refuses SC3002 before emission with the pairing
 *                        named
 *
 * Thread-instanced state (the profile's abi.instance_per_thread): every
 * mutable static in the archive — runtime internals, module globals,
 * run-once guards, regex literal caches — compiles as thread-local
 * storage, so ONE linked archive serves one independent instance per
 * embedder thread through the unchanged entry family (the calling thread
 * is the instance selector).
 *
 *   M6 four threads      one archive, four embedder threads with distinct
 *                        workloads: concurrent instance-local inits,
 *                        independent state and collects, a deliberate trap
 *                        on thread 0 delivered to ITS sink exactly once
 *                        (SC4014, mt_boom, its ctx) poisoning only its
 *                        instance while the other three keep answering
 *                        through and after the trap window; sanitized in

 *   M6 inspect TLS       deterministic two-thread runtime seam proving

 *   M7 composition       a thread-instanced AND runtime-localized archive
 *                        coexists with a second different-prefix localized
 *                        archive in one process (both mechanisms at once);
 *                        the localized link surface stays exactly the
 *                        declared set, with M1's one ASan
 *                        image-registration common in a sanitized build
 *   M8 sanitized rerun   M6 re-run explicitly under ASan (the K10
 *                        precedent: the plain flavor carries an
 *                        instrumented pairing too)
 *   M9 profile shape     abi.instance_per_thread is strictly boolean
 *                        (SC4001)
